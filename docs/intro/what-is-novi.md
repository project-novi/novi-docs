# What is Novi?

Novi is hard to define. It could be a blog, a image collection, a music player, a note taking appâ€¦ you name it. To grasp the gist, Novi is a place of **objects**. Objects can be anything (image, music, video), and you can tag them so you can navigate them easily.

If you want to learn more about the concepts behind Novi (which you *should* since we're still in the concept stage ;) ), check out the [Concepts](/concepts/) page.
